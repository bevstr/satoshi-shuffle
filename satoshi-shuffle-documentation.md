# Satoshi Shuffle Documentation

## Project Overview
Satoshi Shuffle (also known as BlockClock Control) provides tools to control Coinkite BlockClock Mini/Micro devices by displaying custom text messages that rotate on a configurable schedule. The project has evolved from a bash script to a full web application with multiple deployment options.

## Installation Methods

### 1. Basic Python Installation
**For:** Users with some technical knowledge who want direct control  
**Overview:** This method involves the user directly installing the Python application on their system. They would:
- Clone or download the repository
- Install Python dependencies via pip
- Configure their BlockClock devices manually
- Run the application directly with Python commands

This gives users the most control and visibility into how everything works, but requires some familiarity with Python and command-line operations.

### 2. One-Click Script Installation
**For:** Semi-technical users who want a simplified setup but on their own machine  
**Overview:** Your `install.py` script automates most of the setup process:
- Handles dependency installation
- Guides users through device configuration via prompts
- Sets up service files for auto-starting on boot
- Takes care of directory creation and permissions

This provides a middle ground - simpler than manual setup but still runs directly on the user's system without containers.

### 3. Docker Installation
**For:** Users who prioritize simplicity and isolation  
**Overview:** The Docker approach containerizes the entire application:
- Users just need Docker installed on their system
- Everything runs in an isolated container
- Configuration is handled through mounted volumes
- Updates can be applied by simply pulling a new image

This is the most hands-off approach, ideal for users who just want the application to work without worrying about the technical details or potentially interfering with their system.

## Port Configuration

### Default Port
Satoshi Shuffle uses **port 5001** by default for its web interface. This choice was made because the commonly used port 5000 is often occupied by other services (especially on macOS where AirPlay Receiver uses port 5000).

### Troubleshooting Port Issues

If users encounter an error message like "Address already in use" when starting the application, it means port 5001 is already being used by another application on their system.

#### How to Change the Port

1. **Basic Python Installation**:
   Edit the `webapp/blockclock_web.py` file and change the port number in this line:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001, use_reloader=True)
   ```
   For example, change `port=5001` to `port=5002` or another available port.

2. **One-Click Script Installation**:
   The script should handle port conflicts automatically by testing if port 5001 is available, and if not, moving to 5002, 5003, etc. until it finds an available port. If installation completes but the web interface isn't accessible, users should check the logs to see which port was actually used.

3. **Docker Installation**:
   Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and change the port mapping:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "5001:5001"
   ```
   
   To use a different port on the host, change the first number:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "5002:5001"
   ```
   
   This maps port 5002 on the host to port 5001 inside the container.

### For Non-Technical Users

For users who are less comfortable with editing configuration files, we should include a simple troubleshooting note in the README:

> **Can't access the web interface?**
> 
> If you see an error message about the port being in use when starting Satoshi Shuffle, or if you can't access the web interface at http://localhost:5001, try the following:
>
> 1. Try a different port by adding the `-p` flag: `python install.py -p 5002`
> 2. Check if any other applications are using port 5001 and close them
> 3. Restart your computer to release any locked ports
> 4. If using Docker, edit the port mapping in docker-compose.yml to use a different port

## Command Line Cheat Sheet

A command line cheat sheet is essential for users who may not be familiar with terminal commands. This should be included in the documentation as a quick reference guide.

### Basic Operations Cheat Sheet

```

# Standard Python method:
pkill -f blockclock_web.py

# Docker method:
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down

# üìù CHECKING THE LOG FILES
# View last 20 log entries:
tail -n 20 logs/blockclock.log

# Monitor the log in real-time:
tail -f logs/blockclock.log

# üßπ CLEAR THE LOG FILE
echo "" > logs/blockclock.log

# üîÑ RESTARTING THE APPLICATION
# Standard Python method:
pkill -f blockclock_web.py
sleep 2
python webapp/blockclock_web.py

# Docker method:
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml restart

# üîç DEBUGGING
# Check port usage:
lsof -i :5001

# Test if BlockClock devices are reachable:
ping -c 3 [BLOCKCLOCK-IP-ADDRESS]

# üåê CHECKING NETWORK CONNECTION
# Test if WiFi is still connected:
ping -c 5 8.8.8.8

# üïí ENABLE AUTO-START AT BOOT
# Using systemd (Linux):
sudo systemctl enable satoshi-shuffle

# Using launchd (macOS):
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.satoshi-shuffle.plist

# Docker auto-restart:
# (Add "restart: always" to your docker-compose.yml file)
```

This cheat sheet should be:
1. Included in the README.md
2. Made available as a separate CHEATSHEET.md file
3. Potentially printed on a single page PDF for easy reference

## Automated Testing Strategies

### Types of Tests to Consider

#### 1. Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation.

For Satoshi Shuffle, you could unit test:
- The BlockClock core Python module functions
- Configuration loading/saving
- Log rotation logic
- Rate limiting mechanisms

#### 2. Integration Tests
These test how multiple components work together.

For your project, you could test:
- Communication with BlockClock devices (potentially with mock responses)
- Web routes integration with the backend logic
- Configuration changes propagating correctly to the BlockClock control module

#### 3. UI/Frontend Tests
These verify that the user interface works correctly.

You could test:
- Form submissions
- UI updates in response to status changes
- Dark/light mode switching
- Device management UI functionality
