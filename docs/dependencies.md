## üåê Common Requirements (All Installation Methods)

These requirements apply regardless of which installation method you choose:

‚úÖ **Network connection** to your BlockClock device(s)  
‚úÖ **BlockClock Mini or Micro** with:
   - Device on the same network as your computer
   - Static IP recommended for stability
   - Power and internet connectivity

<details>
<summary><b>How to find your BlockClock's IP address</b></summary>

To find your BlockClock's IP address:
- Check your router's connected devices list
- Use a network scanner app (like Fing for mobile)
- Check the BlockClock settings menu directly on the device
- Look for devices named "Coinkite" or "BlockClock" in your network

For most home networks, the IP will typically be in the form of 192.168.1.x or 10.0.0.x

## üß© Installation-Specific Dependencies

### Installation Options

<details>
<summary><b>1Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Installation (Recommended, Try it if you havn't its easy)</b></summary>

For Docker-based installation, you'll need:

‚úÖ **Docker Engine** - [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)  
‚úÖ **Docker Compose** - Usually included with Docker Desktop  
‚úÖ **200MB+ free disk space** (for Docker images, volumes, and application)  
‚úÖ **Git** (recommended for downloading the repo)  

**Note:** Using Docker eliminates the need to install Python or any Python packages directly on your system.

**Basic Docker commands you'll use:**
```bash
# Build and start container
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Check container status
docker ps | grep satoshi-shuffle

# View logs
docker logs satoshi-shuffle
```

**Advantages of Docker Installation:**
- Isolated environment
- Consistent across different systems
- No Python setup required
- Easy to update and maintain

<details>
<summary><b>View network requirements details</b></summary>

Your system must allow communication with your BlockClock:

‚úÖ **Port 5010** must be available on your system (used by the web interface)  
‚úÖ **Outgoing HTTP requests** must be allowed to reach your BlockClock  
‚úÖ **No firewall blocks** between your computer and the BlockClock  

**Checking network connectivity:**
```bash
# Check if your BlockClock is reachable
ping 192.168.1.100  # Replace with your BlockClock's IP

# Check if port 5010 is available on your system
lsof -i :5010  # On macOS/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :5010  # On Windows
```

If port 5010 is already in use, you can change the port in the configuration.
