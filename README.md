## Installation Options



### üê≥ OPTION 1: DOCKER INSTALLATION (RECOMMENDED)

If you havent used Docker give it a go, Its easy just go to [Docker Installation Guide](docs/installation-docker.md)

Using Docker eliminates the need to install Python or any Python packages directly on your system.
Cleanly isolates the application in a container without affecting your system. Provides consistent behavior across different operating systems and simplifies updates. Ideal if you already use Docker for other applications or want to avoid potential conflicts with existing software.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satoshi-shuffle.git
cd satoshi-shuffle

# Build and start the Docker container
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

**Need help?** See the [Docker Installation Guide](docs/installation-docker.md) for detailed instructions.



### üì¶ OPTION 2: ONE-CLICK INSTALLATION 

Helps users who dont want to try docker, which is a crazy thought, by running the install script.
This method guides you through setup with simple prompts, automatically checks requirements, and configures your system with minimal effort. Perfect if you just want the app working quickly without worrying about technical details.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satoshi-shuffle.git
cd satoshi-shuffle

# Run the installation script and follow the prompts
python install.py
```

**Need help?** See the [One-Click Script Installation Guide](docs/installation-script.md) for detailed instructions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### üêç OPTION 3: MANUAL PYTHON INSTALLATION

Best for: Advanced users who want complete control over the installation. But why bother just use Docker.
Gives you direct access to all components for customization. You'll install dependencies yourself and have full visibility into the process. Choose this if you're comfortable with Python development, want to customize the code, or need to integrate with existing systems.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satoshi-shuffle.git
cd satoshi-shuffle

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
python webapp/blockclock_web.py
```

**Need help?** See the [Python Installation Guide](docs/installation-python.md) for detailed instructions.
